# Ollama Playground

Welcome to the Ollama Playground! This repository is where I play and goof around with ollama. It's a mixed bag of code snippets.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
# Example for a Python-based project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You will also need ollama and pull the models. I like playing with `openhermes`as it's fast. 
```bash
ollama pull openhermes
```
